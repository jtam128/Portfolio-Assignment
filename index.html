      <h1>Hi! &#128075 I'm Jessica Tam</h1>
      <p>I am a software developer living in Canton, Massachusetts. I previously worked in Accounting but wanted a fresh start. I saw Software Development as that fresh start for me.</p>

      <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>After graduating college, I worked at a small company as an Accountant and working at a small company taught me how to work with my co-workers whenever we needed to collaborate on something. While I enjoyed the learning opportunities I was given as an Accountant, I found myself feeling unenthusiatic at the thought of continuing to work in the Accounting field. I would like to think that I was given a second chance because I was able to explore my options in a different field.</p>

        <p>I strategized what I wanted to do next and the thought of being a Software Developer came to my mind. I had taken a class in high school where I learned basic web development, I learned about the database software Access in a course in college, I also helped to code some webpages for my dad's dry cleaning company website, and I took some online courses that introduced me to basic coding languages. Through everything I did that revolved around Software Development, I remember always being interested by it. So, I thought I could try to become a Software Developer and thus, began my journey back into Software Development. I refreshed my memory by taking some online courses. All the while I also discovered online bootcamps, like <a target="_blank" href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, which made me believe it is possible to get a fresh start. </p>

        <p>Now I am a student at Thinkful and starting my journey to becoming a Software Developer which I couldn't be more ecstatic about!</a>

          <p>Other Interests of Mine:</p>
          <ul>
<li>Trying new recipies</li>
<li>Watching good movies and tv shows</li>
<li>Catching a good museum exhibit</li>
          </ul>

        <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer (or are looking for a partner for a hackathon) please reach out! I am so excited to work with other developers to build great software.</p>
