# Portfolio-Assignment
My first project while in the Thinkful Software Engineering Bootcamp. I built a simple website portfolio made using HTML and CSS.

While working on this project, I was able to get a basic understanding of how seperate files work together to create a cohesive website that will end up seeing in your browser.
